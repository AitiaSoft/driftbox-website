# Welcome to the DriftBox Blog

We're excited to launch the DriftBox blog — your source for insights on communication, AI, and productivity in the modern workplace.

## What to Expect

In the coming weeks and months, we'll be sharing:

- **Product Updates** — The latest features and improvements to DriftBox
- **Communication Best Practices** — Tips for managing conversations across multiple platforms
- **AI Insights** — How artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work
- **Customer Stories** — Real-world examples of teams using DriftBox to stay organized

## Why DriftBox?

In today's world, conversations happen everywhere — email, Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, and more. Important decisions get lost in message threads. Action items fall through the cracks. Context disappears when someone asks, "What did we decide about that?"

**DriftBox solves this.**

We capture every conversation, understand the context, and surface what matters when you need it. Ask questions in plain English. Get instant answers with source links. Never lose track of a conversation again.

## Join the Waitlist

We're currently in private beta. Join the waitlist to get early access when we launch publicly.
