It was 11 PM on a Tuesday when I realized I'd completely forgotten about a client demo.

The client had mentioned it in an email, confirmed it on a Teams call, and sent a reminder on WhatsApp. Three different apps. My brain was supposed to connect the dots. My brain failed.

Sound familiar?

## The Real Problem

We all use 4 or 5 messaging apps every day. Email, Slack, Teams, WhatsApp — sometimes all of them for the same conversation. And somehow we're expected to keep track of everything across all of them.

I've been building software for over three decades. I still can't keep up. Nobody can.

It's not about getting too many messages. It's that the important stuff — decisions, promises, follow-ups — is scattered everywhere. There's no single place where it all comes together.

## Nothing Out There Fixes This

Email apps organize email. Slack is good at Slack. Teams does Teams. But none of them talk to each other.

You know the feeling. Someone asks you "hey, what did we decide about that project?" and you spend 20 minutes digging through three different apps trying to piece it together. You're the glue holding it all together, and you're stretched way too thin.

## So We're Building DriftBox

The idea is simple: what if something actually *understood* your conversations across every platform?

Not just collected them — understood them.

- **Commitment tracking** — Someone says "I'll send that by Friday"? DriftBox catches it. You say "let me get back to you"? Tracked. No more forgotten promises.
- **Per-person timelines** — Click on anyone, see every conversation you've had with them. Email, Teams, WhatsApp. One thread.
- **Smart summaries** — Ask "what's going on with the Johnson project?" and get an actual answer pulled from every conversation.

It's like having a friend with perfect memory who was CC'd on everything.

## Why Build This Now?

Honestly, I've wanted this for years. But AI in 2026 is finally good enough and affordable enough to make it real. These models can actually understand context and nuance in conversations — not just keywords.

For the first time, this thing is buildable. So we're building it.

## Following the Journey

I'm doing this transparently. The wins, the mistakes, all of it. No corporate speak, no hype. Just honest updates about what it's like to build something from scratch after 35+ years in the industry.

## Want In?

If you've ever lost track of something important because it was in the wrong app — [join the waitlist](/#waitlist). We're early, but we're building something I wish I had a decade ago.
